          A quiz is a form of game or mind sport in which players attempt to
          answer questions correctly about a certain or variety of subjects.
          Quizzes can be used as a brief assessment in education and similar
          fields to measure growth in knowledge, abilities, or skills. They can
          also be televised for entertainment purposes, often in a game show
          format.
